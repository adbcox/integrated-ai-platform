## Description

Track and analyze deployment metrics: deployment frequency, lead time for changes, mean time to recovery, and change failure rate. Enable data-driven deployment decisions.

## Why it matters

Provides visibility into deployment process health. Identifies bottlenecks and improvement opportunities. Tracks progress on deployment efficiency.

## Key requirements

- Deployment frequency tracking (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Lead time calculation (commit to production)
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR) measurement
- Change failure rate tracking
- Deployment pipeline metrics
- Trends and forecasting
- Team-level deployment analytics
- Deployment success vs. failure analysis

## Affected systems

- Deployment analytics
- CI/CD pipeline monitoring
- Operational reporting

## Expected file families

- `analytics/deployment_analyzer.py`
- `analytics/deployment_metrics.py`

## Dependencies

- RM-MON-002 (Metrics visualization)
- RM-DEPLOY-001 (Blue/green deployment)

## Risks and issues

### Key risks
- Metrics definition ambiguity (what counts as deployment?)
- Collection overhead
- Misaligned metrics leading to wrong incentives

### Known issues / blockers
- none; ready to start

## Recommended first milestone

Deployment frequency and lead time tracking with trend analysis.

## Status transition notes

- Expected next status: `In progress`
- Transition condition: Deployment metrics collected and analyzed
- Validation / closeout condition: Deployment analytics dashboard operational with trends
